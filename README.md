# Task 2: Emotion Classification API

## Model Used from Hugging Face

- **Model**: [`j-hartmann/emotion-english-distilroberta-base`](https://huggingface.co/j-hartmann/emotion-english-distilroberta-base)
- **Description**: Multi-class emotion classification of English text (e.g., joy, sadness, anger, fear).
- **Why this Model?**: I chose this model because it has real world applications in various domains. Its clear emotion label predictions make it useful for both  technical and non-technical users. One practical use case is that it can be integrated into commercial chatbot systems to analyze user's emotion tone from conversation This allows business to have an indirect feedback, helping them to improve their services.
